This project is an expense tracker built using Python. The main script is `main.py`, which provides a command-line interface for managing expenses.

## main.py

The `main.py` script is the entry point of the application. It provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the expense tracker.

### Features

* List all expenses: displays all expenses in the system.
* Show total expenses: calculates and displays the total amount of all expenses.
* Filter expenses by category: allows the user to filter expenses by a specific category.
* Exit: exits the program.

### Functions

The `main.py` script uses several functions to perform the above features:

* `add_expense`: adds a new expense to the system.
* `print_expenses`: prints all expenses in the system.
* `total_expenses`: calculates the total amount of all expenses.
* `filter_expenses_by_category`: filters expenses by a specific category.

These functions are defined in the `main.py` script and are used to perform the necessary operations.
